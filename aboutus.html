    Melvin Smith was on his last day of a summer vacation in 2000 when his sandals fell apart at the beach. Not wanting to go barefoot in the hot
    sand, he went looking for a replacement at the beach shops nearby. He noticed that most of the selections were made of inferior quality and expensive,
    but he felt that he had no choice but to buy one. At the end of the day, the sandals were barely useable, and he had blisters from wearing them.
    After arriving home, he decided that no one should have to experience what he went through and vowed to create a shoe company 
    that creates comfortable and durable beach shoes at affordable prices.

    Espalaya (a play on "is for the beach" in Spanish) was born, and today we are in 90% of all beach shops in the United States. Our signature neon green
    logo is hard to miss. Please look through our selections, and buy here or at your local beach stores. We hope that our products exceed your expectations
    and to be a permanent part of your beach wear.
